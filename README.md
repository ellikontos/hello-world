# hello-world
my first repository
It's Saturday morning and I've decided to learn Git!  I endeavour to learn Python and PowerShell on my journey.
I'm updating this file to then commit it to the readme-edits branch and I guess ultimately the main/master branch

I am editing this file again in a separate edits branch

Look at John Hammond's repository:
